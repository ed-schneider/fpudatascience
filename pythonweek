Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.

Kaylin Everett. This seems like a good tool to collaborate when writing programs.

Erick, I like github, and I believe my students will like it also. I would be willing to use it for introduction to coding.
After reading the blog by Dan Meyer about secondary teachers creating and utilizing a "lesson plan Github" for math, I can relate to the frustrations that would arise.  Even if one decides to use a lesson from such a repository, it still needs to be tailored to the class, i.e., EL learners, IEP plans, scheduling, different pacing calendars, etc.  The idea of getting "ideas" seems widely accepted, but not the lesson plans.  Google docs already serves as means to collaborate on lessons, though it could use some work.  The video that explains how Github is useful, with the farmers and their tractors, shows the power of this platform for programers, but implementing this into our profession seems difficult.


Allie Garcia: I think that this can be a great collaboration tool in a data science or computer science class. It reminds me of Google Docs, but for programming and more confusing. 
Korie Love, this program seems like a great place for a coding project!

Sarah Pot. I think Github is a great website for working collaboratively with other people on code projects. Also, it helps keep track of all the changes so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.
Ed Schneider:  I think the concept is amazing.  Being able to collaborate with people from all over the world can be a powerful tool.  That being said, I find the whole thing a bit intimidating and confusing.  This is probably how my students feel when I lecture.
